# L3-2(Ratings)
Text file U2.txt contains information about the student ratings. The first line of the file specifies the name of the faculty and the correct answer, for example: NTNNTNNTTT. The following lines contain the following: student number, student surname, name, answer. Create a class Rating to store data about single student rating. Create a container class Ratings to store all data about given student ratings. Find the number of points T1 collected by student who answered the best. Evaluate all the students. Evaluation should be as follows: if the student obtained the number of points equal to T1 or T1-1, the rating "good", if the number of points equal to T1-2 or T1-3 rating is "satisfactory", the remaining cases - "unsatisfactory." Print results sorted by points and names. In the container, leave only those students who got "good" and remove the other students. Print after removal.
